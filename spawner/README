Spawner is the script that manages currently running games. Its role is to
provide an interface between game engine and frontend, so that we can update
the frontend without killing running games.

It might be responsible to compile codes.

It has to protect itself from errors in AIs. For example, instead of starting AI
in a regular way (./ia) it can pass this kind of command line to the game
engine:

timeout 5 cpulimit -l 10 -i firejail --profile=jail.profile ./ai
