Engine is the part of marabuntu that executes one match based on one scenario.
There is no control except for the game itself.

It is inttented to be launched by a spawner, which add additional checks (such
as cpu limitation, jail, timeout and so on) and manages multiple games.

However, engine can be started alone for tests purposes:
./marabuntu_engine <scenario> <ia command 1> [ia command 2]...

The first argument is the scenario
Next arguments are commands to start IA (one argument per team)
Notice that commands composed of multiple words should be sent as unique
argument (e.g. protected in quotes)
