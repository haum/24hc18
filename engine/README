Engine is the part of marabunta that executes one match based on one scenario.
There is no control except for the game itself.

It is intented to be launched by a spawner, which add additional checks (such as
cpu limitation, jail, timeout and so on) and manages multiple games.

However, engine can be started alone for tests purposes. See documentation.
